Title: Team Discovery Prompt — Improve `/attorneys` for Paid Attorney Users

Role instructions:
- Answer as a focused panel: Product Manager, UX Designer, Trial Attorney User, Litigation Paralegal, Data Engineer, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, QA Lead.
- Keep answers practical. No generic design advice.
- Assume users are paid attorneys/paralegals and need complete counsel contact intelligence quickly.

Questions:
1) What are the top 3 user tasks this page must optimize for?
2) What must be visible on-card without clicking?
3) What should be filterable/searchable in one step?
4) What are acceptable dedup rules for attorneys with inconsistent PACER blocks?
5) Which sorting modes matter most for legal workflows?
6) How do we keep full contact blocks available without making cards unusable?
7) What actions should be one-click from each card?
8) What pagination/volume controls are needed?
9) What edge cases should QA prioritize?
10) What is the minimum "done" definition for this iteration?

Output format:
- Role-by-role bullet responses.
- Then a single prioritized implementation list: P0, P1, P2.
