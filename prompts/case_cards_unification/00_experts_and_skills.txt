Title: Expert Roster + Skill Set (Case Cards Unification)
Target model: OpenAI Codex v0.98.0 | gpt-5.3-codex | xhigh

Objective
Unify "Case Cards" (/admin/federal-data-dashboard/case-cards), "Indexed Cases" (/admin/pcl/cases), and "Case Reports" (/admin/case-data-one) into one canonical "Cases" (name TBD) experience without losing functionality or breaking other components. The end result should be attorney-friendly by default and still support admin/ops workflows via progressive disclosure.

Experts (the perspectives we need to satisfy)
1) Attorney SME (litigation workflow)
- What they need in the first 30 seconds: court, case number, caption/title, judge, filed/terminated, parties/counsel, procedural posture, key filings, deadlines, and a direct path to the docket.
- Preferred language: plain English, minimal jargon, no "developer speak," no AI-flavored filler.

2) Product + UX / Information Architecture
- One entry point. Clear next step. Progressive disclosure. Predictable navigation.
- Eliminate duplicate destinations that look like "different ways to do the same thing."

3) PACER/PCL domain expert
- Token/session lifecycle, billable vs non-billable flags, throttling (429s), batch report limits, PCL remote job cleanup.
- Docket retrieval edge cases (login redirects, docket form vs docket report, XML/HTML differences).

4) Backend engineer (Flask + SQLAlchemy)
- Routes, redirects, and keeping URL compatibility stable.
- Query performance and correctness.
- Avoid transaction poisoning (aborted transactions), safe upserts, savepoints.

5) Frontend engineer (Jinja + CSS + vanilla JS)
- Reusable template partials, consistent components, accessibility (labels, aria-live), mobile responsiveness.
- Avoid bulky pages by default; use <details> for advanced sections.

6) Data engineer
- Understand that `pcl_cases` and `case_data_one` are different schemas/datasets.
- Avoid premature schema merges; design safe linking strategy if matching is needed.

7) QA / Test engineer
- Regression checks for:
  - navigation links
  - case filtering
  - pagination
  - docket queue actions
  - imported-case browsing
- Smoke test script that does not require pytest (since pytest may not be installed).

8) Security + privacy
- Ensure PACER credentials/tokens never leak into UI or logs.
- Redaction and safe display of receipts/debug info.

9) DevOps / Render.com
- Background workers (cron vs request-driven), environment variables, deploy sequencing.
- Confirm that redirects and route changes do not break gunicorn startup or worker scripts.

10) GitHub / release engineering
- Small, reviewable commits.
- Keep backwards compatibility and document deprecations.
- Provide rollback plan (easy to revert a redirect or nav change).

11) Technical writer
- Microcopy that is direct, attorney-friendly, and not AI-sounding.

12) Project manager
- Scope control, milestones, risk register, and a clear definition of "done."

Skills (what the implementation needs to demonstrate)
- Requirements elicitation (ask the right questions before merging features).
- System mapping (routes -> templates -> queries -> tables).
- UI consolidation with backwards-compatible redirects.
- Template refactoring (partials/includes) to avoid duplicate code.
- Data-source labeling ("PACER indexed" vs "Imported legacy") to prevent user confusion.
- Progressive disclosure (simple-by-default with an "Advanced" section).
- Testing plan and a feedback loop for errors (logs, a "report a problem" path, or at least a reproducible error capture).
