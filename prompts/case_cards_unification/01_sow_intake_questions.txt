Title: SOW Intake Prompt (Stakeholder Questions)
Audience: Admin users, attorneys, and internal dev/ops stakeholders

Context
Today, the admin UI has three different places that look like "case lists":
- Case Cards: /admin/federal-data-dashboard/case-cards
- Indexed Cases: /admin/pcl/cases
- Case Reports (Case Data One): /admin/case-data-one

As a result, users do not know which page to use, and the UX feels fragmented.

Proposed SOW (draft)
We will deliver ONE canonical "Cases" experience (final name TBD) that:
1) Combines the capabilities of Case Cards + Indexed Cases (same underlying PACER/PCL dataset).
2) Includes the Case Reports dataset in a clearly labeled way (or deprecates/hides it if it is no longer required).
3) Preserves all existing functionality, data, and existing endpoints (either kept or redirected safely).
4) Is attorney-friendly by default (simple, clear guidance, minimal noise), with advanced operations available via progressive disclosure.

Questions (please answer with short bullets)
1) Primary user
- Who is the primary "Cases" user?
  - Attorney (default)
  - Admin ops (default)
  - Both, with role-based UI

2) Dataset decisions
- Do we still need the imported "Case Data One" dataset in day-to-day work?
  - Yes (critical)
  - Yes (rare/legacy)
  - No (can remove from nav; keep only for archival)

3) Canonical naming
- What should the single destination be called?
  - Cases
  - Case Cards
  - Case Workspace
  - Something else

4) Default view
- When a user clicks the canonical destination, what should they see first?
  - Card grid optimized for attorneys
  - Ops/triage view (bulk actions, provenance, saved searches)
  - A small chooser ("Browse" vs "Operations")

5) Must-keep features (rank top 10)
- From Indexed Cases (/admin/pcl/cases):
  - Bulk queue docket enrichment
  - Saved searches + run history panels
  - Segment provenance + status
  - Advanced filters (field contains, status flags)
  - Copy case number
  - Other: ______
- From Case Cards (/admin/federal-data-dashboard/case-cards):
  - Simpler filter form
  - Minimal card layout
  - Other: ______
- From Case Reports (/admin/case-data-one):
  - Card view search for parties/judges
  - Upload/import status
  - Error report + OpenAI "error prompt" helper
  - Other: ______

6) Attorney-friendly card content
- What fields must appear on each card (the "front" of the card)?
  - Example options: court, case number, caption, judge, filed date, parties/counsel, enrichment status, sentencing flags, last updated, tags.
- What actions must be one click away?
  - Example options: open docket, open case detail, pull docket, download documents, add notes, export.

7) Permissions
- Should attorneys see the same admin-only tools (run saved searches, view receipts, debug fields)?
  - Yes
  - No (hide behind admin toggle)
  - Separate role-based nav

8) Backwards compatibility
- Can we redirect old URLs to the new canonical destination?
  - Yes (preferred)
  - No (must keep old pages as-is, but we can add strong guidance and cross-links)

9) Performance expectations
- Typical case volume and acceptable load time:
  - 0-5k cases / < 1s
  - 5k-100k / < 2s
  - 100k+ / < 3s

10) Success criteria
- What does "done" look like (measurable)?
  - Example: "No duplicate 'case list' nav items; attorneys can find a case and open docket in < 3 clicks; no regressions in docket queue."
