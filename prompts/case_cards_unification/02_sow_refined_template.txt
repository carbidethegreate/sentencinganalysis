Title: SOW Refinement Prompt (After Stakeholder Answers)
Target model: OpenAI Codex v0.98.0 | gpt-5.3-codex | xhigh

Instructions
You will be given:
1) The stakeholder answers to "01_sow_intake_questions.txt"
2) The repo context (Flask app in app.py, templates in templates/, queries in pcl_queries.py)

Task
Write an improved Scope of Work (SOW) for unifying the case experiences into ONE canonical "Cases" destination.

Constraints
- Do not remove data or drop tables.
- Do not break existing endpoints; use redirects if approved.
- Keep attorney-friendly language and microcopy (no AI-sounding filler).
- Prefer UI consolidation first; avoid schema merges unless explicitly required.

Output format (single document)
1) Project summary (1 paragraph)
2) Personas and primary workflow
3) In-scope deliverables (explicit list)
4) Out-of-scope (explicit list)
5) UX decisions (naming, default view, progressive disclosure plan)
6) Technical plan (routes/templates/queries; redirects/back-compat)
7) Data considerations (pcl_cases vs case_data_one; matching strategy if any)
8) Testing plan (smoke tests; regression checklist)
9) Rollout plan (deploy steps; rollback steps)
10) Acceptance criteria (measurable)
11) Risks and mitigations
