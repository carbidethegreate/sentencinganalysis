Goal
- Make case cards attorney-usable when searching by counsel.
- Case cards MUST list all counsel names on the card (not a truncated preview like "Name A; Name B (+6 more)").
- The primary search box MUST match any counsel name on the case, even if that counsel is not first in the list.
- Do not break existing routes, workers, or docket enrichment.

Problem Summary
- Current case-card search relies on `pcl_case_fields.field_value_text` for `docket_party_summary`.
- `field_value_text` is intentionally truncated (~2000 chars) for index safety, so long party/count summaries can truncate later counsel names.
- Result: searching counsel by name can miss cases where counsel appears later in the summary.

Requirements
1. Counsel display
- On `templates/partials/pcl_case_card.html`, show ALL counsel names.
- Keep cards compact: allow wrapping; if needed, constrain height and make the counsel section scrollable.

2. Counsel search
- In `_build_where_clauses` (see `pcl_queries.py`), update the primary search (`q`) to also match on non-truncated JSON fields:
  - `docket_attorney_names` (JSON list)
  - `docket_party_names` (JSON list)
  - `docket_judges` (JSON list)
  - `docket_charges` (JSON list of dicts)
- Do NOT rely solely on `docket_party_summary` text.
- Keep the existing case-number/title search.

3. Stable derived fields
- Ensure docket enrichment stores large-enough JSON lists for party/counsel names so that "ALL counsel" can be displayed and searched.
- Preferred: update name list limits to a safe higher cap (e.g., 250+) in `docket_enrichment.py`.
- Keep `docket_party_summary` text truncation intact for index safety.

4. Future-proof data model (proposal)
- Propose (and optionally implement) a normalized entity table to avoid truncation and simplify search:
  - `case_entities` with columns: `case_id`, `entity_type` (judge|party|counsel|charge), `value`, `value_normalized`, `source_field`, timestamps.
  - Unique constraint on (`case_id`, `entity_type`, `value_normalized`).
  - Index on (`entity_type`, `value_normalized`).
- Backfill from existing `docket_header_fields` / `docket_parties` / `docket_attorneys`.
- Update enrichment to keep it in sync.

Acceptance Tests
- Searching for a counsel name that appears later in a long docket (example: "Alexandre Mikhail Dempsey") returns ALL matching cases, not only the ones where the name appears early.
- Cards display all counsel names and remain readable on desktop and mobile.
- No regressions to infinite scroll / card loading endpoints.

Deliverables
- Code changes with clear comments.
- If a schema change is proposed: include a migration and a backfill script.
